= How to build your own tutorial for the Couchbase Tutorials Site

== Introduction

All tutorials are grouped under the tutorials component and are displayed on the tutorials https://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/index.html[landing page] with the metadata highlighted.
The metadata combined with the site search is geared to provide quick access to tutorials that may be of interest to the user.
The tutorials component is a version-agnostic and each tutorial will list the components and versions used to build the tutorial.

== Workspace

This section describes how to set up your workspace.

If you've never built the site on your device, complete the xref:home:contribute:install-antora.adoc[Install Antora] steps first. You must also go to https://gulpjs.com/ and follow the installation instructions (currently on the front page) in order to install gulp.

Once Antora and gulp are installed, run through the following step:.

. In a new folder, create a new file **local-antora-playbook.yml** with the following.
+
[source,yml]
----
site:
  title: Couchbase Docs (Tutorials)
content:
  sources:
  - url: ./tutorials
    branches: HEAD
----
. From that same folder, clone the tutorials repository.
+
[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/couchbase/tutorials.git
----
. Build the local preview.
+
[source,console]
----
gulp
----
You can now open http://localhost:5000/tutorials/index.html in a web browser which should load the tutorials index page.
If you notice that the links on the page are broken, don't worry, it's happening because we haven't cloned any tutorial content.
+
The https://github.com/couchbase/docs-site#file-watcher-and-livereload[docs-site readme] has more information about using gulp with Antora.

== Create a new tutorial from the template

The following steps can be used as the starting point to build your own tutorial.

. Clone the tutorial template.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorial-template
----
. Insert this new source in your **local-antora-playbook.yml** file.
+
[source,yml]
----
  - url: ./tutorial-template
    branches: HEAD
----
. Build and verify your tutorial locally.
It should be visible on http://localhost:5000/tutorials/tutorial-template/sample.html
. Edit the tutorial template and <<metadata-parameters, Metadata Parameters>> with details of your tutorial.
. To submit a change to the site playbooks, you can open a pull request on the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorials[tutorials] repository to insert your tutorial in *staging-antora-playbook.yml* and *production-antora-playbook.yml*.
+
[source,yml]
----
  - url: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorial-template.git
    branches: master
----

== Update the Left Navigation

The navigation tree for a tutorial is kept in the module with the rest of the content.
The following steps describe how to add a new menu item in the left navigation.

. Create a new file **module-name/pages/_partials/nav.adoc** to declare the navigation tree for your tutorial.
Insert the following.
+
----
* Hello World
----
. Next, update the root nav in **tutorials/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc** file to include your tutorial nav.
+
----
.Nav title for new tutorial
\include::module-name:partial$nav.adoc[]
----
. Edit **module-name/pages/_partials/nav.adoc** until you are happy with the output.
The xref:home:contribute:update-nav.adoc[contribution guide] contains examples of navigation trees.
. To submit a change to the root *nav.adoc*, you can open a pull request on the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorials[tutorials] repository.

NOTE: The steps described above apply to all tutorials except `userprofile-couchbase-mobile` for iOS/Xamarin/Android.
The navigation for those tutorials is located in the `userprofile-couchbase-mobile` repository on the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/blob/standalone/content/modules/userprofile/nav.adoc[standalone], https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/blob/query/content/modules/userprofile/nav.adoc[query], and https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/blob/sync/content/modules/userprofile/nav.adoc[sync] branches.

== Add a Tutorial Card

The xref:tutorials::index.adoc[tutorials index page] provides a central location to find tutorials.
The following steps describe how to create a card for your tutorial.

. Update the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorials/blob/master/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc[index.adoc] file to include your new tutorial.
+
The tutorial information (title, description, components, etc.) must be valid AsciiDoc and follow a pre-defined layout.
The following code block describes the AsciiDoc layout.
To add or update an existing card, you can submit changes to the *index.adoc* as a pull request on the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/tutorials[tutorials] repository.
